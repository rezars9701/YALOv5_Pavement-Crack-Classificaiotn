# TRBAIAC-PAVE
This is the benchmark model for TRB AI Committees Open Data Challenge on pavement distress detection and analysis. Top-down views of pavement image data containing 7 main distress types annotated with bounding boxes are provided (via aiac_main.ipynb). The repo also includes a tutorial on how to train, test models and submit results for evaluation. The modeling framework uses a deep convolutional neural network model with an architecture borrowed from YOLOV5.
